The easiest way to ensure cohesion is by color-matching **[modern dining table accessories](https://threadvibeliving.com/collections/dining-set-mega-menu)**. If your table runner is bold and colorful, opt for neutral placemats — and vice versa. Much like how a **[cool dog statue for home](https://threadvibeliving.com/products/cool-dog-figurine-for-home-decor)** placed in the hallway brings quirky character without overpowering the space, placemats and runners should complement, not compete with each other.

## 2. Layer Your Look

Layering creates a luxurious and rich appearance. Place the table runner first, then layer the placemats across it, perpendicular to the runner’s path. This layered styling works beautifully **[cutlery set for dining table](https://threadvibeliving.com/collections/cutlery)** during festivals or family get-togethers and gives your table a designer finish.

## 3. Mix and Match Textures
